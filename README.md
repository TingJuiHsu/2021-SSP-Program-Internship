# 2021-SSP-Program-Internship
Machine learning for classifying images by feature engineering in python.

Advisor : Prof. YAMADA Seiji

Student : Ting-Jui Hsu

# Dataset : ImageNet (https://image-net.org/index.php)

* I use tiny imagenet 200 dataset. (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/tiny-imagenet)
* I choose random 5 images to show each class.

# Phase 1 : Feature Engineering
* TWO image classes 

n01443537	goldfish, Carassius auratus

n01629819	European fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra

* FOUR image classes 

n01855672	goose

n01698640	American alligator, Alligator mississipiensis

n02123394	Persian cat

n03837869	obelisk

* SIFT and bag-of-features 

# Phase 2 : Classification Learning Experiments
* 2-classes classification learning by XGBoost
* 4-classes classification learning by XGBoost
